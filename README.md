# Jotto

A deductive word game written in python

## Description

Jotto is a deductive word game with the purpose of correctly guessing a 5 letter word. The secret word is a valid scrabble word, and no proper nouns are allowed.

The player submits valid 5 letter words as guesses, and the game returns the number of letters from the guess word that match a letter in the secret word. This number of matching letters is called the jots.

### Examples

If the secret word is 'games', and the guess word is 'soggy', there are 2 jots: one for the matching 'g', and one for the matching 's'.

If the secret word is 'apple', and the guess word is 'peels', there are 3 jots for the 'p', 'l', and 'e'.

When the secret word is correctly guessed, that's Jotto!
